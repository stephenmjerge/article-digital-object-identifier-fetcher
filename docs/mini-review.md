# Mini-Review Outline — Section 1

**Section 1 Goal:** Frame the clinical/theoretical gap Lab X cares about and summarize the top articles pulled via `adoif export-lab lab_x`.

## 1. Hook / Motivation
- Clinical problem statement (1–2 sentences) — e.g., treatment-resistant depression and ketamine outcomes.
- Why Lab X focuses on this space (PI interest, ongoing trial, etc.).

## 2. Guiding Question(s)
- Primary: *How effective are rapid-acting interventions in sustaining remission beyond 4 weeks?*
- Secondary: *What biomarkers or patient characteristics predict sustained benefit?*

## 3. Evidence slots (tie back to Lab X DOI list)
1. **Foundational RCT** — `10.1038/s41591-021-01627-4`
   - Key metrics to summarize (sample size, response rates, AE profile).
2. **Real-world outcomes** — `10.1001/jama.2019.0018`
   - Observational or registry data; highlight external validity.
3. **Mechanism paper** — `10.1016/j.biopsych.2020.06.015`
   - Signal toward biomarker/EEG findings.
4. **Emerging biomarker** — `10.1177/0956797617709813`
5. **Safety/monitoring** — `10.1371/journal.pmed.1003582`

Use the Lab X DOI file for the latest list; swap in the real articles as you refine.

## 4. Synthesis
a. One paragraph summarizing converging evidence.
b. One paragraph on gaps/next steps.

## 5. Next steps
- Section 2 will cover methodological weaknesses + future study design.
- Add figure outline (e.g., flow diagram or evidence map) once data extraction tables are ready.
