# Issues

Log bugs and feature requests in the shared GitHub project or capture quick items in `LAUNCHPAD/next-actions.md`. Every issue should document:

- Example DOI or PDF that triggered the problem.
- CLI flag combination (see `README.md` for options).
- Any network or API prerequisites.

Use the roadmap milestones inside `ROADMAP.md` to prioritize what gets scheduled each week.
